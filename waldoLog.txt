Starting to build the program that will separately build the database. The thought is to build something that
will take as arguments the .csv file that contains all of the information and the name of the database to output,
and then create something that a version of De-identification.py can use to create a k-anonymous database.

Moved creation of the country/continent table to the buildDB.py function. Have started
to find places where some information was just printed out and moved into places where
it is only printed when a verbose option is picked.

Currently, every time that De-identification.py is run, it builds the whole sqlite
database from a .csv file that contains the information on courses. This database
contains two tables; one which is unmodified and one that is used to anonymize the 
data. 

This functionality can, and should, be split into different programs. One will create
the database, containing a (mostly) unmodified version of the csv file (that itself
contains the course and person data) and another that starts by removing the anonymized 
table, copying the original table, and then working on the anonymization.

In de_id_functions.py:
	Needed to install:
		pycountry
		pp
		pygeoip
	
	changed undeclared and unused variable c to cursor in a number of functions; assumed to be a typo
	
in De-identification.py
	Removed a bad space at line 515
