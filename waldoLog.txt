Added code to buildEquivClasses.py to allow the building of the equivalence classes from a .db file as
well as from the .csv.

Back to the code (although some has been generated without adding to the log). Starting by moving all of
the code needed to build the database into buildDB.py, so that it won't clutter up the de_id_functions.py.
Moved splitDate(), idGen2(), and sourceLoad() into the buildDB.py. Also making buildDB.py directly
executable, which should make things easier.

Added a check to buildCourseDict.py to make sure that the courses being added to the dictionary are listed in
a canonical order (I just used dictionary order). It turns out that this makes a difference-- the concatenation
of the classes taken by a student might differ in order only, so putting them in the same order will cut
down on some of the uniqueness.

Starting to build the program that will separately build the database. The thought is to build something that
will take as arguments the .csv file that contains all of the information and the name of the database to output,
and then create something that a version of De-identification.py can use to create a k-anonymous database.

1/29/15
Moved creation of the country/continent table to the buildDB.py function. Have started
to find places where some information was just printed out and moved into places where
it is only printed when a verbose option is picked.

1/8/15
Currently, every time that De-identification.py is run, it builds the whole sqlite
database from a .csv file that contains the information on courses. This database
contains two tables; one which is unmodified and one that is used to anonymize the 
data. 

This functionality can, and should, be split into different programs. One will create
the database, containing a (mostly) unmodified version of the csv file (that itself
contains the course and person data) and another that starts by removing the anonymized 
table, copying the original table, and then working on the anonymization.

In de_id_functions.py:
	Needed to install:
		pycountry
		pp
		pygeoip
	
	changed undeclared and unused variable c to cursor in a number of functions; assumed to be a typo
	
in De-identification.py
	Removed a bad space at line 515
