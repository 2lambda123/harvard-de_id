'''
Run buildcountrygeneralizer.py to generate a group of generalization files for countries.
The base name of the files that will be produced is countryGen, to which will be appended the string that is
the first member of the pairs in bin_info, and with bin sizes that are the second of the pair in the list of bin_info.
Current values are 0 (no binning), 5k, 10k, 15, 20k, and 25k. The script assumes that a pickled dictionary mapping
countries to larger regions exists two directories above the script and is named 'country_continent'
